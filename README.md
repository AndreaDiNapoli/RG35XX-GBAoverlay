This repository contains custom overlay for GBA retroarch cores, specifically made for the abernic RG35xx.

The overlay are personal adaptation to the great overlay pack made by mugwomp_93, in order to center the screen and be suitable to use without the need for a demanding video filter.
Credits to him!
